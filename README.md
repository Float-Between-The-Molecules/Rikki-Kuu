# Rikki Kuu

An arcade-paced, physics-based, drone-building space combat simulator.

This is the official repository for the core game code, the base game content, and any other officially maintained mods and/or content packs.

More information coming soon, re-organization of project in progress, excuse the mess...


## Modding

(work in progress)

The goal is for content in the `mods` folder here, to work by copying it into a `mods` folder where the game is installed. The base game mod will be a guiding principle until a formal convention is established.
